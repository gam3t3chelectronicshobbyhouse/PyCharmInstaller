</br>
Thank you to Pi-Apps for giving me credit in Pi-Apps.</br>
Anyone not using Pi-Apps https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/</br>
You will love it start using it.</br>
</br></br>
Quick installer:</br>
download and extract code to your Downloads folder</br>
open terminal Ctrl+T on your keyboard</br>
Type: cd Downloads  (Hit Enter) </br>
Type: cd PyCharmInstaller-main (Hit Enter)</br>
Type: sudo bash installer (Hit Enter)</br>
Allow the installer to finish. Once finished </br>
you may not have the icon for pycharm in your icons </br>
you will have to launch PyCharm in terminal</br>
Type: cd /opt/pycharm/bin  (Hit Enter) </br>
Type: bash pycharm.sh </br>
(note: you may need sudo launch pycharm to run some updates through the program)</br>
when you start it up you should have a gear icon and be able to add shortcut from there </br>
If not then you can launch PyCharm and on the top menu bar</br>
goto-->Tools select Create Desktop Entry</br>
This should add it to your programming tab and/or put a icon on the desktop</br>
</br></br>
Now if you are using Pi-Apps eventually your program will update but do not update through the program.</br>
If you do update through pi-apps you can adjust the program to install the 2021.1 version of PyCharm</br>
I can always provided info after on this.</br>
</br>
I have taken their script and altered it to be a standalone as sometimes newer version of the program come out</br>
but applications are not updated quickly enough for people to benefit from it.</br>
</br>
If you are using one of the patch files at the moment this method is not working and I would recommend using the installer here</br>
</br>
((update:) Pi-Apps as of 06-15-2022 has current 2022.1.2 version script available.)
</br>
PyCharm currently as of April 17th on Pi-Apps is at version 2020.3.5 which if you can update to that you will have</br>
no issues once the install is available to upgrade to 2021.1 which I assume they will do soon.</br>
</br>
I would like to thank all of you on youtube that had brought this to my attention that 2021.1 was not working.</br>
</br>
With that being said I will continue to test and keep the installer here active and up to date with the most current versions</br>
of PyCharm and update accordingly if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out to me anytime.</br>
</br>
Once again great job from the guys @ Pi-Apps your work is awesome! can't wait to see what comes next!</br>
