PyCharm Install

Thank you to Pi-Apps for giving me credit in Pi-Apps.
Anyone that uses Pi-Apps https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/
you will love it.

Now if you are using Pi-Apps eventually your program will update but do not update through the program.
If you do update through pi-apps you can adjust the program to install the 2021.1 version of PyCharm
I can always provided info after on this.

I have taken their script and altered it to be a standalone as sometimes newer version of the program come out
but applications are not updated quickly enough for people to benefit from it.

If you are using one of the patch files at the moment this method is not working and I would recommend using the installer here

PyCharm currently as of April 17th on Pi-Apps is at version 2020.3.5 which if you can update to that you will have
no issues once the install is available to upgrade to 2021.1 which I assume they will do soon.

I would like to thank all of you on youtube that had brought this to my attention that 2021.1 was not working.

With that being said I will continue to test and keep the installer here active and up to date with the most current versions
of PyCharm and update accordingly if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out to me anytime.

Once again great job from the guys @ Pi-Apps your work is awesome! can't wait to see what comes next!
